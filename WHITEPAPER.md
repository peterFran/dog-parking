## **2. Venue Access Management System**

### **Strategic Approach: QR Code + Human Verification**

**Design Philosophy:** Leverage human intelligence rather than expensive hardware systems.

#### **System Architecture**
```
Customer Journey:
1. User books service via mobile app
2. Booking confirmation generates signed QR code
3. Customer arrives at venue, displays QR code
4. Employee scans QR code using mobile device
5. Verification screen shows dog photo and details
6. Employee confirms visual match and checks in dog
```

#### **Technical Implementation**
```typescript
// QR Code Generation
const generateAccessQR = (booking: Booking) => {
  const payload = {
    booking_id: booking.id,
    dog_id: booking.dog_id,
    venue_id: booking.venue_id,
    valid_date: booking.start_time,
    expires_at: booking.end_time + 1hour
  }
  
  const signature = jwt.sign(payload, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '24h' })
  return QRCode.generate(signature)
}

// Employee Verification Interface
const DogVerificationScreen = {
  dogPhoto: booking.dog.photo_url,
  dogDetails: {
    name: "Max",
    breed: "Golden Retriever",
    age: 3,
    specialInstructions: "Feed at 12pm, medication in bag"
  },
  ownerContact: {
    name: "Sarah Johnson",
    phone: "+44 7700 900123",
    emergency: "+44 7700 900456"
  }
}
```

#### **Security Features**
- **JWT Signed Tokens:** Prevent QR code tampering
- **Time-based Expiry:** Codes expire after service window
- **Venue-specific Validation:** QR only works at booked location
- **Single-use System:** Codes become invalid after check-in
- **Audit Trail:** Complete logging of access events

#### **Advantages Over Enterprise Systems**
| **QR + Human System** | **Enterprise Access Control** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cost: £0 additional | Cost: £5K-20K per venue |
| Setup: 1 week | Setup: 4-8 weeks |
| Flexibility: Instant updates | Flexibility: Hardware dependent |
| Maintenance: Software only | Maintenance: Hardware + software |
| Scalability: Infinite venues | Scalability: Hardware per location |

## **3. Employee Management Strategy**

### **Strategic Decision: Explicit MVP Descoping**

**Employee management has been explicitly descoped from the MVP** to focus resources on core customer-facing functionality and market validation.

#### **Rationale for Descoping**
- **Complexity:** Payroll, scheduling, and compliance add significant development overhead
- **Regulatory Burden:** UK employment law, HMRC compliance, pension obligations
- **Resource Focus:** Core booking and customer experience provide higher ROI
- **Market Validation:** Prove customer demand before investing in operational complexity

#### **Partnership Strategy: Rover Model**

**Phase 1: Service Provider Marketplace**
Instead of direct employment, leverage existing pet care provider networks:

```yaml
Model: Customer → Platform → Vetted Provider
Revenue: £50 booking → £10 platform fee → £40 to provider
Benefits:
  - Zero employee overhead
  - Flexible capacity scaling
  - Proven provider vetting (via Rover)
  - Lower operational risk
```

**Alternative Partnership Models:**
- **Franchise/License:** License platform to existing pet care businesses
- **White Label:** Providers use platform under their brand
- **Revenue Sharing:** Technology provision with operational partnerships

#### **Future Implementation Path**
```yaml
MVP: Partnership model for rapid launch
Month 6-12: Evaluate partnership performance vs direct employment
Year 2: Consider hybrid model with both options
Year 3: Data-driven decision on optimal employment mix
```

---

## **4. Identity Verification & KYC Strategy**

### **Strategic Decision: KYC Descoping**

**KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements have been explicitly descoped** based on service industry analysis and risk assessment.

#### **Rationale**
- **Physical Verification:** Customers meet staff in-person at service delivery
- **Service Industry Standard:** Gyms, restaurants, retail services don't require KYC
- **Risk Profile:** Pet care services are low financial crime risk
- **User Experience:** KYC creates unnecessary friction for service signup

#### **Industry Comparison**
| **Service Type** | **KYC Required** | **Verification Method** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Banking/Investment | ✅ Required | Government ID, address proof |
| Gym Membership | ❌ Not required | Payment method verification |
| Restaurant Booking | ❌ Not required | Phone/email confirmation |
| **Dog Care Services** | ❌ Not required | **Physical meeting + service delivery** |

#### **Social Login Authentication**
```yaml
Authentication Stack:
  Primary: Firebase Social Login
    - Google OAuth (primary)
    - Apple Sign-In
    - Facebook (optional)
  
  Verification: Email verification only
  
  Identity Confirmation: In-person at first service visit
    ✅ Customer matches booking name
    ✅ Pet matches registration
    ✅ Payment method verification
    ✅ Emergency contact confirmation
```

**Security Advantage:** Physical verification provides stronger identity assurance than digital-only KYC processes.

## **5. Payment & Subscription Model**

### **Monthly Hour-Block Subscription System**

**Core Philosophy:** Combine predictable subscription revenue with bulk pricing incentives, similar to ClassPass model but using time-based credits.

#### **Pricing Structure**
```yaml
Ad-hoc Pricing:
  - £28/hour (full hour bookings)
  - £15/30 minutes (premium rate = £30/hour equivalent)
  - £200/10-hour block (bulk discount to £20/hour)

Subscription Tiers:
  Light Plan: £100/month → 5 hours (£20/hour, 30% savings)
  Standard Plan: £200/month → 10 hours (£20/hour, 29% savings)  
  Family Plan: £380/month → 20 hours (£19/hour, 32% savings)
```

#### **Subscription Mechanics**
```yaml
Hour Allocation: Monthly refresh on billing date
Rollover Policy: Up to 50% of monthly allocation
  - Light: 2.5 hours max rollover
  - Standard: 5 hours max rollover
  - Family: 10 hours max rollover

Overage Pricing: £25/hour (subscriber discount vs £28 ad-hoc)
Additional Blocks: 
  - 5-hour top-up: £120 (£24/hour)
  - 10-hour top-up: £220 (£22/hour)
```

#### **Business Model Benefits**
```yaml
Revenue Predictability:
  1000 subscribers example:
    400 Light × £100 = £40k/month
    500 Standard × £200 = £100k/month
    100 Family × £380 = £38k/month
    Base Revenue: £178k/month guaranteed
    
Customer Behavior:
  ✅ Predictable monthly spend
  ✅ Higher customer lifetime value
  ✅ Reduced price sensitivity
  ✅ Regular usage habit formation
```

#### **Technical Implementation**
```typescript
interface UserSubscription {
  user_id: string
  plan_id: string
  current_period_start: Date
  current_period_end: Date
  hours_used_this_period: number
  hours_rolled_over: number
  total_hours_available: number
}

const processBooking = (userId: string, duration: number) => {
  const subscription = getUserSubscription(userId)
  const hoursNeeded = duration / 60
  
  if (subscription.total_hours_available >= hoursNeeded) {
    return { price: 0, source: 'subscription' }
  }
  
  const overageHours = hoursNeeded - subscription.total_hours_available
  return { 
    price: overageHours * 25, 
    source: 'overage' 
  }
}
```
