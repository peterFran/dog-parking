## 🏗️ What Gets Deployed

### AWS Resources
- **4 Lambda Functions** (512MB each, Python 3.11)
  - Dog Management (CRUD operations)
  - Owner Management (registration, profiles)
  - Booking Management (scheduling, pricing)
  - Payment Processing (simulated payments)

- **4 DynamoDB Tables** (on-demand billing)
  - Dogs (with owner index)
  - Owners (with email index)
  - Bookings (with owner-time index)
  - Payments (with booking index)

- **1 API Gateway** (REST API with CORS)
  - `/dogs` - Dog management endpoints
  - `/owners` - Owner management endpoints
  - `/bookings` - Booking management endpoints
  - `/payments` - Payment processing endpoints

- **CloudWatch Log Groups** (14-day retention)
  - Automatic logging for all Lambda functions
  - Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Set up local development
```bash
cd /Users/petermeckiffe/Documents/workspace/dogparking
./local-setup.sh
```

### 2. Deploy to AWS
```bash
./deploy.sh dev dog-care-app
```

### 3. Test the API
```bash
# After deployment, get your API URL from the output
API_URL="https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev"

# Register an owner
curl -X POST $API_URL/owners/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","phone":"+1234567890"}'
```
